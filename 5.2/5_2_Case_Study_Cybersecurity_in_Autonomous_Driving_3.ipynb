        "### Sensor Fusion and Spoofing in Autonomous Systems  \n",
        "Autonomous vehicles rely on **multi-sensor fusion**, combining data from complementary sensors such as cameras and LiDARs to perceive their environment accurately. Each sensor type has strengths and weaknesses — for example, cameras provide rich color and texture information, while LiDAR offers precise depth measurements. Fusing their outputs can significantly improve perception robustness and decision-making.  \n",
        "\n",
        "However, autonomous systems are also vulnerable to **sensor spoofing attacks**, where false or corrupted data is injected into sensor streams. These attacks can degrade model accuracy and lead to dangerous misperceptions. Understanding how spoofing impacts sensor fusion systems is crucial for designing resilient AI-based perception pipelines.  \n",

        "## Problem Statement  \n",
        "The purpose of this experiment is to analyze the **impact of sensor spoofing** on multi-sensor data fusion. The system models two sensors — a simulated camera and LiDAR — generating synthetic data with controlled correlations. By introducing artificial spoofing noise to one sensor, the experiment compares classification accuracy across individual and fused sensor models.  "
